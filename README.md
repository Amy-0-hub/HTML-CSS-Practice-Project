# HTML & CSS Practice Project

This repository is based on my pratice following the [HTML & CSS Course]**https://youtu.be/mU6anWqZJcc?si=7cjjdp7N4pjUeo-a** by freeCodeCamp Media.


## Project Purpose

The main goal of this repo is to **practice and deepen my understanding of CSS**, especially how it works with HTML structure. The HTML file includes is **not complete** - it only contains part of the original content from the tutorial. All the focus is on expermenting with **CSS styling, layout, and design techniques**.


## What I Practice

- CSS selectors (class, id, element)
- Styling text, backgrounds, and layout
- Using Flexbox to create flexible page structures
- Playing with spacing: margin, padding, border. Also, **css box model**
-Basic responsive design ideas
