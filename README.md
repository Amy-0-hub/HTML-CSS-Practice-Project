# HTML & CSS Practice Project

This repository is based on my pratice following the [HTML & CSS Course]**https://youtu.be/mU6anWqZJcc?si=7cjjdp7N4pjUeo-a** by freeCodeCamp Media.

## Project Purpose

The main goal of this repo is to **practice and deepen my understanding of CSS**, especially how it works with HTML structure. The HTML file includes is **not complete** - it only contains part of the original content from the tutorial. All the focus is on expermenting with **CSS styling, layout, and design techniques**.

## What I Practice

- CSS selectors (class, id, element)
- Styling text, backgrounds, and layout
- Using Flexbox to create flexible page structures
- Playing with spacing: margin, padding, border. Also, **css box model**
- Basic responsive design ideas

ðŸ“Œ **Note:**

- Most of my hands-on CSS practice, layout experiments, and style testing are in `css_copy/styles.css`. This file serves as my working draft while learning.
- All modifications and learning experiments are done mainly in the **CSS files**
- This is a personal learning project â€” not meant to replicate the original tutorial fully

## ðŸ§ª How to View

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Explore `style.css` and `css_copy/styles.css` to see how styles were applied and tested
